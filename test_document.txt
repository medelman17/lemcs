LEGAL MEMORANDUM

RE: Breach of Contract Analysis

ISSUE
Whether the defendant's failure to provide timely repairs constitutes a material breach of the lease agreement under California Civil Code Section 1941.

BRIEF ANSWER
Yes, the defendant's failure to repair the heating system within a reasonable time constitutes a material breach of the warranty of habitability.

DISCUSSION
The warranty of habitability is implied in all residential leases in California. Landford v. Tenant, 123 Cal. App. 4th 456 (2004). When a landlord fails to maintain essential services, it constitutes a breach.

Here, the defendant failed to repair the heating system for over 30 days despite multiple requests from the tenant.
