These violations demonstrate a calculated pattern of unconscionable terms designed to circumvent fundamental statutory protections established by the New Jersey Legislature to protect residential tenants from exploitative lease practices. The provisions create misleading impressions about tenant rights, attempt to waive non-waivable statutory protections, and impose grossly one-sided terms through contracts of adhesion.

Additionally, under N.J.S.A. 12A:2A-108, lease provisions that are procedurally or substantively unconscionable are unenforceable.

The Act specifically prohibits lease provisions that create misleading impressions about tenant rights or that could chill the exercise of statutory protections. The Anti-Eviction Act establishes that tenant protections against arbitrary eviction and unconscionable lease terms cannot be waived through private agreement, reflecting the legislature's recognition that such protections are essential to maintaining fair housing practices.

This violates the Truth in Renting Act's prohibition on misleading lease terms that could discourage tenants from asserting their rights. The attorney-in-fact delegations attempt to secure prospective waiver of non-waivable statutory rights, creating inherent conflicts of interest where landlords purport to act on behalf of tenants in matters directly adverse to tenant interests, thereby violating the Anti-Eviction Act's prohibition on waiving tenant protections. The provisions demonstrate both procedural unconscionability through their presentation in adhesive contracts without meaningful opportunity for negotiation, and substantive unconscionability through their grossly one-sided character that systematically advantages landlords while disadvantaging tenants.

Second, the unconscionability doctrine recognizes that apparent consent obtained through contracts of adhesion and misleading terms is insufficient to enforce unconscionable provisions, particularly where there is no meaningful choice or opportunity for negotiation. Third, the legislature's determination that certain tenant protections are fundamental and non-waivable reflects a policy judgment that individual consent cannot override these protections, especially given the inherent inequality of bargaining power in residential lease negotiations.

The unconscionable nature of these terms, combined with their direct contravention of mandatory statutory protections, compels the conclusion that they cannot be enforced against tenants under any circumstances. The systematic pattern of violations across multiple provisions suggests a calculated effort to operate outside New Jersey's carefully calibrated framework of tenant protection, undermining the legislature's clear intent to provide meaningful protections for residential tenants.
