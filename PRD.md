## Legal Memoranda Consolidation System (LeMCS)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** May 30, 2025  
**Author:** Legal Technology Team  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Legal Memoranda Consolidation System (LeMCS) is an AI-powered document processing platform designed to consolidate multiple legal memoranda into comprehensive omnibus documents while preserving all critical legal analysis, citations, and maintaining continuous prose format. The system addresses the challenge of analyzing complex residential lease agreements containing 73+ provisions across 25+ separate memoranda, creating litigation-ready documentation for both individual and class action lawsuits.

### Key Objectives
- Automate consolidation of multiple legal memoranda without loss of detail
- Maintain narrative prose format throughout (no bullet point reversion)
- Preserve all citations, case law references, and legal arguments
- Create litigation-ready documents suitable for complaint drafting
- Enable pattern recognition across standardized lease provisions

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Manual Consolidation Failures**: Existing attempts to combine memoranda result in:
   - Loss of critical legal details and nuanced arguments
   - Automatic reversion to bullet-point format
   - Broken citation chains and missing case references
   - Inconsistent narrative flow

2. **Scale Complexity**: 
   - 25+ detailed memoranda analyzing different aspects of the same lease
   - 73+ individual lease provisions requiring analysis
   - Multiple overlapping legal theories (habitability, Truth in Renting Act, unconscionability)
   - Need for pattern recognition across standardized provisions

3. **Litigation Requirements**:
   - Documents must be suitable for direct extraction into complaints
   - Class action potential requires systematic violation documentation
   - Preservation of verbatim lease language is critical

### Impact
- 200+ hours of manual consolidation work per case
- Risk of losing critical arguments in translation
- Difficulty identifying systematic patterns across provisions
- Delayed litigation preparation

## 3. Solution Overview

LeMCS employs a multi-agent AI architecture using specialized legal NLP tools orchestrated by LangGraph to create a sophisticated document consolidation pipeline that:

1. **Analyzes** each memorandum to extract legal theories, citations, and arguments
2. **Maps** relationships between provisions and violations
3. **Synthesizes** content into theory-based narrative sections
4. **Validates** citation integrity and cross-references
5. **Generates** litigation-ready omnibus documents

### Core Components
- **Orchestration Layer**: LangGraph-based multi-agent system
- **Legal NLP Engine**: eyecite, LexNLP, and spaCy with legal models
- **Document Processing**: docxcompose for format preservation
- **Knowledge Base**: PostgreSQL with vector embeddings for semantic search
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation and human-in-the-loop review
